7. click on "plugin"
8. click on "upload..."
9. Optional: Refresh the GUI to see if the plugin loaded correctly.

## compiling the client
Just do `npm i` in order to install dependencies, then `npm run build` to build into a single file located in the build folder. 
Typescript *might* complain about the plugin API not being defined, but will build anyway. Do not worry about this.
