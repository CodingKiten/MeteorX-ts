# MeteorX
#### a hacked client made with eagler reborn's plugin api

# installing the client
1. this client is made with eagler reborn's plugin api so you need to [compile the latest version of eagler reborn](https://eaglerreborn.github.io/guide/#actually-compiling-the-client)
2. download the latest version of the client by going to [this link](https://github.com/radmanplays/MeteorX-ts/blob/main/latest_build/meteorx.js) and clicking on "download"![image](https://github.com/radmanplays/MeteorX-ts/assets/95340057/73d92a42-a748-4bbf-9115-72a87f32515d)

3. launch the latest version of compiled eagler reborn
4. click on "options"
5. click on "plugin"
6. click on "upload..."
7. Optional: Refresh the GUI to see if the plugin loaded correctly.
## compiling the client
Just do `npm i` in order to install dependencies, then `npm run build` to build into a single file located in the build folder. 
Typescript *might* complain about the plugin API not being defined, but will build anyway. Do not worry about this.
