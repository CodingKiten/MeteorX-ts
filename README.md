#### a hacked client made with eagler reborn's plugin api
## compiling the client
Just do `npm i` in order to install dependencies, then `npm run build` to build into a single file located in the build folder. 
Typescript *might* complain about the plugin API not being defined, but will build anyway. Do not worry about this.
